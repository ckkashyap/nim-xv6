# Each non-boot CPU ("AP") is started up in response to a STARTUP
# IPI from the boot CPU.  Section B.4.2 of the Multi-Processor
# Specification says that the AP will start in real mode with CS:IP
# set to XY00:0000, where XY is an 8-bit value sent with the
# STARTUP. Thus this code must start at a 4096-byte boundary.
#
# Because this code sets DS to zero, it must sit
# at an address in the low 2^16 bytes.
#
# Startothers (in main.c) sends the STARTUPs one at a time.
# It copies this code (start) at 0x7000.  It puts the address of
# a newly allocated per-core stack in start-4,the address of the
# place to jump to (mpenter) in start-8, and the physical address
# of entrypgdir in start-12.
#
# This code is identical to bootasm.S except:
#   - it does not need to enable A20
#   - it uses the address at start-4, start-8, and start-12
